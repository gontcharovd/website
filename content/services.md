I help industrial enterprises transfer OT data from SCADA to Databricks.

# 1. SCADA Data Integration

Your valuable operational data is trapped in legacy SCADA systems and historians. Engineers waste hours manually extracting data while various teams complain about missing data.

Imagine having a clear view of your OT data flowing seamlessly into Azure and Databricks. Get instant access to any historical data point, enabling you to build automated alerts based on predictive models, and real-time KPI dashboards across your asset portfolio.

I connect your SCADA systems to Databricks using the right tools for the job. I set up reliable data flows that track errors and keep a record of where all your information comes from. This lets you get value from your data without having to replace your existing SCADA equipment.

# 2. OT Data Quality Testing

Bad data quality issues undermines confidence in your asset monitoring insights. False alarms trigger unnecessary spam while critical anomalies go undetected. Should you use Great Expectations or Soda Core? And how do you implement this framework in Databricks?

Imagine having complete trust in your OT data. Every dataset is backed by validated metrics, with automated compliance reporting using quality scores. Your teams focus on operations, not questioning data.

I build aan automated data quality testing framework that checks if your OT data is accurate and reliable in Databricks. This includes automatic tests that verify your data is correct and easy-to-read reports that show data quality for each part of your operation. My solution helps you maintain high-quality data long after our work together is complete.

# 3. Databricks Project Guidance

You have many IT people configuring Databricks, but not many people *using* Databricks? Your analytics project stay in the proof-of-concept phase. You're unsure of which Databricks features to leverage.

Imagine having a precisely architected Databricks environment where engineers and business users collaborate effectively. Work confidently within established patterns, new solutions deploy rapidly, and you extract maximum value from your Databricks investment.

I use my industry experience and Databricks expertise to create a simple blueprint for your project. I work with your team to build reusable tools they can apply again and again. Together, we'll set up practical guidelines that keep your data organized while still allowing for creativity and innovation.
