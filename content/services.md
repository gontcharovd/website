*A low pressure call without any commitments to see if we're a good fit.*

# 1. Data Quality Assessment

Your company plans a digital project whose outcome depends on the quality of your internal data. This data lies scattered across many different systems. You're unsure if some data is missing, or whether available data hasn't got any errors. You feel your internal team lacks the competences to evaluate the risk effectively.

Imagine having a clear map of where which data lies. You'll know what data you have, and more importantly, don't have. Have a clear score about your company's data quality. You'll have confidence in the outcome of your project.

I will map out your company's internal data systems and identify the relevant data sources. I will identify relevant data required for your use case. For this data, I will objectively evaluate the data quality and present you with a clearly interpretable metric.

# 2. SCADA-to-Databricks Integration

Your company invested in Databricks to centralize operational data from SCADA systems across multiple sites, but rollout is stalling. Each plant has different SCADA vendors and local data workflows, local teams resist changing their processes, and collaboration between IT, OT, and Business is sluggish.

Imagine having increasing Databricks adoption across all sites with operational time series data flowing reliably. Have clear ownership of common problems in your SCADA data pipelines systems leading to minimal data disruptions.

I coordinate across your digital teams building your Databricks platform, your business stakeholders, and your local OT personnel to align everyone toward a common goal. I help will establishing clear escalation processes for data issues bridging the gap between centralized data strategy and local SCADA reality. Local plant personnel often don't speak fluent English. I can support in German, French, Dutch, and Russian.

# 3. Requirements & Business Scoping

Your platform vendor promised a solution, but nobody documented what your business actually needs. IT builds what they think operations wants, operations complains it doesn't work, and the project burns budget without delivering value.

Imagine having clear, documented requirements that align technical capabilities with actual business processes, before expensive implementation begins.

I facilitate requirements gathering across business stakeholders, translate operational needs into technical specifications, and define realistic project scope that avoids scope creep and wasted investment. You will receive a comprehensive technical document containing the business scope and requirements.

# 4. Migration Risk Assessment

Your company is migrating from legacy systems to a modern data platform. The technical architecture looks good on paper, but you're worried about what you don't know: hidden dependencies, organizational resistance, or costly mistakes during transition.

Imagine having a clear view of the shortcomings of your internal team's capabilities and company data. Have a realistic migration plan that identifies risks before they become expensive problems, with clear mitigation strategies.

I audit your current migration plan from both technical and organizational perspectives, identify gaps vendors won't tell you about, and help you avoid the mistakes that derail most platform migrations. I will deliver you a clear and neutral assessment with no conflict of interest.
