# Data Quality Framework Implementation

You can't trust your operational data. Sensor drift, missing timestamps, and SCADA inconsistencies mean your team questions every insight. Worse, regulators require accurate reporting—bad data quality creates compliance risks and audit failures.

Complete confidence in your data. When dashboards show turbine performance or grid metrics, your team trusts the numbers. Regulatory reports pass audits without question.

I build data quality frameworks using Soda Core that continuously monitor your time series streams. The system automatically detects anomalies, validates readings, and flags issues before they impact decisions. Deployed with Databricks Asset Bundles for seamless scaling.

# Automated Data Pipeline Troubleshooting

It's 3 AM—wind turbine data stopped flowing. Your engineer manually investigates network issues, SCADA problems, database connectivity. Hours of lost production data and expensive troubleshooting calls.

Pipeline issues detected and resolved automatically, often before your team knows there was a problem. No more midnight calls, no more lost data.

I develop intelligent monitoring systems that watch your data pipelines. When sensors go silent, the system runs diagnostics, attempts common fixes, and provides detailed reports for issues requiring human intervention.
