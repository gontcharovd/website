# 1. SCADA Data Integration

Your valuable operational data is trapped in legacy SCADA systems and historians. Engineers waste hours manually extracting information while critical production decisions are delayed due to inaccessible data.

A unified view of your operational data flowing seamlessly into Databricks. Instant access to any historical data point, automated alerts based on predictive models, and real-time KPI dashboards across your asset portfolio.

We build robust connectors between legacy systems and Databricks, automate extraction with error handling, and establish complete data lineage. Your operational data becomes a strategic asset without replacing existing SCADA investments.

# 2. Data Quality Testing

Data quality issues undermine confidence in your asset monitoring insights. False alarms trigger unnecessary maintenance while critical anomalies go undetected. Your team struggles with framework selection and implementation in Databricks.

Complete trust in your operational data. Every decision backed by validated metrics, with automated compliance reporting and quality scores. Your teams focus on operations, not questioning data integrity.

We implement a tailored quality framework for industrial data on Databricks, with automated validation pipelines, ML-based anomaly detection, and domain-specific scorecards. Our approach ensures long-term quality excellence beyond our engagement.

# 3. Databricks Use Case Architecture

You see Databricks' potential but lack senior engineering expertise to implement it effectively. Projects stall from feature indecision, cloud costs escalate without proportional value, and inconsistent implementations duplicate effort.

A precisely architected environment where business use cases have clear technical paths. Engineers work confidently within established patterns, new solutions deploy rapidly, and you extract maximum value from your Databricks investment.

Our certified Databricks experts provide tailored reference architectures, reusable accelerators for common patterns, and governance frameworks balancing innovation with standardization. We build your internal capability while delivering immediate business value.
