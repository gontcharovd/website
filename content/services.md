# SCADA-to-Databricks Platform Rollout Advisory

The Problem: Your company invested in Databricks to centralize operational data from SCADA systems across multiple sites, but rollout is stalling. Each plant has different SCADA vendors and local data workflows, teams resist changing their reporting processes, and coordination across IT, OT, and Business is chaotic.

The Outcome: Successful Databricks adoption across all sites with operational data flowing reliably, clear governance for SCADA integrations, minimal disruption to plant operations, and buy-in from local teams.

How I Help: I coordinate multi-site rollouts of Databricks platforms across European industrial operationsâ€”managing stakeholder alignment between IT and operational technology teams, establishing escalation processes for data connectivity issues, and bridging the gap between centralized data strategy and local SCADA reality. Fluent support in English, German, French, Dutch, and Russian.

# Requirements & Business Scoping

The Problem: Your platform vendor promised a solution, but nobody documented what your business actually needs. IT builds what they think operations wants, operations complains it doesn't work, and the project burns budget without delivering value.

The Outcome: Clear, documented requirements that align technical capabilities with actual business processes, before expensive implementation begins.

How I Help: I facilitate requirements gathering across business stakeholders, translate operational needs into technical specifications, and define realistic project scope that avoids scope creep and wasted investment.

# Operational Data Reliability

The Problem: Critical reports are delayed because of data issues at remote sites. Network connectivity problems, SCADA inconsistencies, or sensor drift create gaps, and by the time anyone notices, a 10-minute fix has cost days of delay and regulatory risk.

The Outcome: Reliable reporting across all sites with rapid issue detection and clear escalation processes. Your team trusts the data, regulators get accurate reports, and problems get resolved in hours, not days.

How I Help: I design governance frameworks and cross-team coordination processes that ensure SCADA data reliability across distributed operations. Not by building technical solutions, but by establishing the organizational processes that make technical solutions actually work.

# Migration Risk Assessment

The Problem: Your company is migrating from legacy systems to a modern data platform. The technical architecture looks good on paper, but you're worried about what you don't know: hidden dependencies, organizational resistance, or costly mistakes during transition.

The Outcome: A realistic migration plan that identifies risks before they become expensive problems, with clear mitigation strategies and stakeholder buy-in.

How I Help: I audit migration plans from both technical and organizational perspectives, identify gaps vendors won't tell you about, and help you avoid the mistakes that derail most platform migrations.
