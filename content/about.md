> I'm an OT Data Engineer who helps industrial enterprises with connecting legacy SCADA systems to Azure Databricks.

Since the start of my career in 2018, I have been fascinated by industrial data. Most of my work was on the interface where legacy plant systems meet modern IT solutions. I'm a big believer that industrial data can be used to improve operations, provided it's of high quality - that is my mission.

Today I work as an independent consultant focusing on Digital Transformation, data quality testing, and system integration. Industries I serve include aluminium production and recycling, renewable energy, and discrete metal manufacturing.

Before founding my consulting business I was employed as a data engineer at the aluminium rolling and recycling company Novelis. There, I was responsible for transferring process data from rolling mills and cast house furnaces to the cloud.

I began my career as a process engineer at the aluminium smelter of TRIMET at Saint-Jean-de-Maurienne in France. Later I was working as a process engineer at their smelter in Essen, Germany where I developed control software for the electrolysis process.
