Since 2018, I have been driven by a passion for industrial data and its potential to revolutionize operations. My journey has been marked by a commitment to bridging the gap between legacy plant systems and cutting-edge IT solutions, with a particular focus on leveraging Databricks to analyze and optimize industrial data.

Today, I specialize in helping industrial enterprises harness the power of Databricks to analyze their data effectively. As an independent consultant, I focus on Digital Transformation, data quality testing, and system integration, all centered around the capabilities of Databricks. I serve a variety of industries, including aluminium production and recycling, renewable energy, and discrete metal manufacturing.

Before embarking on my consulting career, I honed my skills as a data engineer at Novelis, an aluminium rolling and recycling company. There, I was instrumental in transferring process data from rolling mills and cast house furnaces to the cloud, utilizing Databricks to ensure high-quality data analysis.

I began my career as a process engineer at TRIMET's aluminium smelter in Saint-Jean-de-Maurienne, France. Later, I continued my work at their smelter in Essen, Germany, where I developed control software for the electrolysis process. These experiences have equipped me with a deep understanding of industrial processes and the importance of high-quality data in driving operational excellence.
