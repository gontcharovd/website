Apologies for the hiatus in writing! Truth is, I've been very busy over the holidays with interviewing for the role of Business Development Representative (BDR) at Databricks in Amsterdam - and I'm happy to report I got the job!

This means I'm no longer working as an independent consultant/contractor offering Databricks services. Instead, I'm going to leverage my knowledge and experience with Databricks to *sell* this product to the Benelux market.

I'll keep this newsletter but will change the content from technical to more business-oriented topics:

* Translating technical features into business value.
* My transition from engineering into tech sales.
* New Databricks features.

If that's your thing - stick around! If not - don't feel bad about unsubscribing.

As always, feel free to reply directly to this email! Hoping to hear from you in the new year...
