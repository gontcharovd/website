I think this is the end of the road for my vibe-coding. Over the last three weeks, I have [vibe-coded a nutrition app](https://gontcharov.eu/newsletter/20250702/). I must say that I'm very happy with the result. I'd say the app is about 80% finished.

However, I'm reaching a point where the AI is starting to struggle. It consumes a lot of prompts and tokens to iron out the bugs. This is in line with what over people have been saying. I suppose a human is still needed to finish the last 20%.

Overall I consider this AI project as a success: In less than 30 hours, I have developed 80% of an app. Now it's up to me to finish the final 20%. I guess I will have to learn React after all, sigh...
