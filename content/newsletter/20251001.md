title: "Scala Case Classes versus (regular) Classes Gotcha"

When re-coding an exercise from the book "Learning Spark 2nd Edition", I wrote:

```scala
val rnd = scala.util.Random(123)
```

This resulted in the error:

```stdout
scala.util.Random.type does not take parameters
```

What's going on? Surely, according to the [docs](https://www.scala-lang.org/api/2.12.4/scala/util/Random.html#%3Cinit%3E(seed:Int):scala.util.Random) I should be able to set the seed.

Turns out, Random is not a case class - it's a regular class. Regular classes don't have the `apply` method defined that allows `val myNumberInstance = myNumberCaseClass(123)`.

Regular classes require the use of `new` to define a new instance: `val myNumberInstance = new myNumberCaseClass(123)`.

Up to now, I've mostly worked with Spark Datasets that involve case classes (in their schema definitions). Case classes are often used for data modeling.
