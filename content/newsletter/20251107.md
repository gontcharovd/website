Two weeks ago I noticed an interesting LinkedIn post by [Jim Gavigan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jimgavigan/). He introduced the idea of "Datatude" and how it pertains to succeeded or failing at a digital transformation initiative.

Datatude is a tongue in cheek metric for the digital (data) readiness of a company. It can be likened to a score across several dimensions (data quality, digital infrastructure, culture, etc.). In essence, it allows companies to gauge their readiness before embarking on a major transformation.

In an industry where massive budgets are spent without much insight or care about the existing landscape, this is a very welcome change.
