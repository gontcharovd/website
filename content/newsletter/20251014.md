I've lived through several hype-cycles throughout my data-career: IoT, VR, Metaverse, Blockchain, and now AI (LLMs). At the risk of sounding contrarian, I've never heard a business stakeholder ask for any of these technologies. (These are usually pushed down by the board higher up.) 

What business really wants are last month's numbers for reporting that's due.  It sounds trivial, but were not there yet. Party why data engineering is still so important today, and arguably more important than ever, is because this need has not been fulfilled yet.
