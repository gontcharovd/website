What a ride! I can look back on an amazing first week.

What I liked most were not the perks nor the benefits, but how motivated all my colleagues are. All the people I've met so far, really try to be the best at their job.

My sales territory will be **healthcare and life sciences**, meaning I will focus on uncovering Databricks use cases at hospitals, big pharma companies, and health insurance companies in the Benelux. I'll work with a handful of Account Executives who work on all sorts of accounts - from greenfield to large enterprises.

Besides my usual onboarding, I set myself a secret challenge of booking one meeting in my first week. I was very happy that by Friday end of day I managed to book a meeting with a prospect for next week. The best onboarding is still *just getting stuck in* - I picked up the phone and started dialing.

I realize it's still early, but for my first week in sales, I feel that the work suits me: I still leverage my technical know how, but now I also leverage other previously unused parts of my brain - that are likely stronger than my technical part - making the work feel natural.

Super stoked about what's to come!
