Taking a break from learning Spark and returning the focus on my business.

It came under my attention that Databricks adoption on the enterprise scale[^1] never fails due to technical difficulties. The biggest issues I've seen, is a lack of interest from the business users: the data/business analysts that need data for their work.

I've never heard a business user ask for a machine learning model nor an AI Agent. Almost always, it's something simple as "last month's production data".

I'm thoroughly convinced, that the IT/Tech world became completely disconnected from the business they are trying to serve. The advent of LLM's and Agentic AI only made this worse.

Which brings me to my business pivot:

As I evolved from the business/engineering side toward the IT/tech side, I believe I'm in a firm position to help enterprises in energy-intensive industries get more benefits out of their data platform (Databricks).

It'll take some time to crystallize the thoughts out of my nearly seven years of industry experience. Writing, to myself, feels like the best way to accomplish this.
