I'm currently working on a blog post and video about Databricks Asset Bundles (DAB). DABs make it easy to deploy Databricks resources to various Databricks workspaces (dev, test, and prod) using CI/CD, e.g. GitHub Actions or Azure DevOps pipelines.

Not long ago, Databricks released their Free Edition that is supposed to replace the Community Edition. Great! This saves me about 70 Euro per month on my Azure bill. And just in time for my blog post!

However, just like the Community Edition, the Free Edition doesn't support multiple workspaces... That being said, it's complete in all its other features. I guess I will just simplify the DAB by deploying to only one Databricks workspace.
