# Data Pipeline Monitoring with Delta Live Tables

This week, I'm diving into one of the most critical aspects of industrial data operations: monitoring your data pipelines to ensure reliability and data quality.

## What to Expect

In this newsletter, I'll be covering:

- **SCADA Integration Challenges**: Real-world problems and solutions when connecting legacy SCADA systems to modern data platforms
- **Databricks for Industry**: Practical use cases and implementation strategies for industrial data
- **OT/IT Convergence**: Best practices for bridging operational technology and information technology
- **Case Studies**: Deep dives into successful industrial data transformation projects

## This Week's Highlight

One of the most common challenges I see in industrial environments is dealing with inconsistent data formats from different SCADA systems. Many organizations struggle with:

- Multiple data protocols (Modbus, OPC-UA, DNP3)
- Varying timestamp formats
- Different sampling rates
- Legacy system constraints

The key is to implement a robust data normalization layer that can handle these variations while maintaining data integrity and traceability.

## Quick Tip

When designing your SCADA to Databricks pipeline, always implement proper error handling and data validation at the edge. This prevents corrupt or incomplete data from propagating through your analytics pipeline.

Thanks for reading! I'd love to hear about your industrial data challenges. Reply to this email or reach out on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gontcharovd).
