Over the last two weeks I've worked extensively with the relatively new Databricks Asset Bundle (or DAB) feature. In a nutshell, DABs allow you to deploy Databricks resources, i.e. notebooks, workflows, pipelines, automatically by declaring them in a YAML file. An analogy would be Terraform for cloud resource deployment. 

I especially appreciated the definition of different targets: dev, test, and prod. This allows you to automatically deploy changes to your Databricks resources by making commits/PRs on a branch. So new commits to my `main` branch will deploy changes to the production Databricks workspace. Commits to `develop` to my development workspace, and `test` for testing.

It's really neat how variables (like Data Catalog names) can be scoped to a particular target in one *databricks.yml* file, to have different values for each target.

Are you already using Databricks Asset Bundles?
