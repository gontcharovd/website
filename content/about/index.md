I'm Denis Gontcharov. I work as a Business Development Representative at Databricks in Amsterdam.

Before joining Databricks I was as independent data engineer helping data product owners in manufacturing and energy with ingesting time series data from SCADA systems into Azure Databricks. I've worked over six years with industrial data and control systems before transitioning into my current sales role. I hold a degree in Materials Engineering from KU Leuven in Belgium.

Outside of work, my greatest passion are European languages. I'm native in Dutch and Russian and fluent in English, French, and German. I no longer actively develop software, but to scratch my nerdy itch I still explore every new Databricks feature and play with my Void Linux configuration.

On this website you will learn more about what drives me. I write a newsletter about transitioning from engineering into tech sales at Databricks to which you can [subscribe here](https://gontcharov.eu/newsletter/).
