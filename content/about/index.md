I'm Denis Gontcharov. Since the start of my career in 2018, I've occupied myself with processing industrial time series data.

I believe in Databricks as the unifying platform for large industrial time series data, combining my favorite technologies neatly in one place: Spark ran by SQL, R, and Python, orchestrated by Airflow, and hosted on Azure cloud.

I was always fascinated by transformation. Especially of matter and energy. My love for chemistry led me to major in materials with a minor in chemical engineering. In my first job as a process engineer at an aluminium smelter, I experienced first hand how a dry white powder transforms into liquid metal.

Since then, I've worked at several industrial plants. Controlling a continuous process, be it an aluminium smelter, gas distribution network, or wind mill farm, requires careful manipulation of data. But, unlike matter and energy, I could manipulate data with the tips of my fingers from the comfort of my chair, transforming raw data into fascinating insights. And so my love for data was born.

Today, I work as an independent data engineer helping digital product owners in energy & utilities ingest time series data from legacy SCADA systems into Azure Databricks.
