 In this episode of the Smart Metals Podcast Denis and I, dive into the topic of transferring shop floor data to the cloud and leveraging AI for predictive maintenance and other use-cases in the metals industry.

We discuss essential components like the Unified Namespace (UNS) and Data-Centric AI, highlighting why smaller manufacturers shouldnâ€™t shy away from cloud technology.

We also break down common misconceptions about AI, particularly for SMBs, and explore the benefits of cloud services.
Youâ€™ll hear a step-by-step approach to implementing predictive maintenance and get practical advice on how to start using AI-driven insightsâ€”without excessive costs or complexity.

If you're a manufacturer looking to make data-driven decisions, optimize maintenance strategies, and leverage AI in a practical, actionable way, this episode is a must-listen.

# Notable Quotes

Notable Quotes:

> "We always break it down into having a solid data infrastructure and having a solid data strategy. And both of these concepts can be summarized with two words respectively: the Unified Namespace and Data-Centric AI." â€“ Denis Gontcharov

> "Very often, we talk about AI and especially cloud, and smaller manufacturers think, â€˜Oh, thatâ€™s something for enterprises.â€™ The goal today is to dispel this myth and tell you that the cloud is far more accessible than you may imagine." â€“ Denis Gontcharov

> "Preventive maintenance is like going to the gym and eating healthy to avoid getting sick, while predictive maintenance is like wearing a smartwatch that warns you when youâ€™re about to have a health issue." â€“ Luke van Enkhuizen

> "If weâ€™re just copying our existing systems to the cloud, why would anyone use them there instead of on-premises? We have to provide them with something betterâ€”something with more context, better-organized data, and real insights." â€“ Denis Gontcharov

> "The cloud is not just a place to store data; itâ€™s a new way of organizing infrastructure. If weâ€™re just renting a big computer in the cloud and copying all our applications, weâ€™re not using the cloud in the right way." â€“ Denis Gontcharov

> "Manufacturers shouldnâ€™t fear the cloudâ€”itâ€™s not just for enterprises. Because of its pay-as-you-go structure, itâ€™s surprisingly affordable and far more flexible than building your own data center." â€“ Denis Gontcharov

> "AI equals model plus data. The old way focused on tweaking the model, but today, improving the data itselfâ€”what we call Data-Centric AIâ€”often leads to better results." â€“ Denis Gontcharov

> "If someone comes to your factory and says, â€˜We have the perfect solution for you, and it costs six digits,â€™ you should probably walk the other way." â€“ Luke van Enkhuizen
