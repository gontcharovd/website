Navigating Digital Transformation in Multi-Site Enterprises.

Do you struggle with managing digital transformation across multiple factories in different countries? Navigating cultural and technological disparities can be tricky. Let's explore how enterprise manufacturers can overcome these challenges for successful multi-site deployments.

In this episode of the Smart Metals Podcast, hosts Luke van Enkhuizen and Denis Gontcharov delve into the complex world of digital transformation across multi-site enterprises. 
They discuss the challenges and opportunities of deploying a unified digital strategy either top-down or bottom-up, exploring the pros and cons of each approach. The conversation highlights the difficulties of standardization across different cultures, languages, and technologies, and how these factors can impede seamless integration. 
They propose a middle-ground solution using a 'unified namespace' architecture to balance centralized control with local flexibility, aiming to streamline operations while respecting the unique needs of each site. 
The episode touches on practical advice for starting digital transformation initiatives, emphasizing the importance of addressing local problems within an overarching enterprise strategy.
