This week at Smart Metals Podcast, we, the hosts Denis Gontcharov and Luke van Enkhuizen, had a conversation about implementing Unified Namespace (UNS) in manufacturing environments with Brian Pribe, founder and president of MACH Controls LLC. We explored how to make advanced manufacturing technology accessible to businesses of all sizes. 

We delved deeper into practical implementation of UNS, the combination of MQTT and Kafka, and making these solutions affordable for smaller manufacturers. If your current challenge is connecting your manufacturing equipment or implementing a unified namespace solution, then listen to this episode when you have a moment.

# Notable Quotes

> "The Unified Namespace isn't just about connecting devices - it's about contextualizing data in a way that makes sense for your business." – Brian Pribe

> "For non-critical applications, open source all the way. Start with FOSS solutions. It's not going to cost you anything, and it's going to push you in the right direction." – Brian Pribe

> "You can only improve what you measure. And if you're not measuring anything, you're not going to improve at all." – Brian Pribe

> "I think the biggest challenge is not per se that the machines don't have the connectivities. It's the fact that most users of the machines are not even remotely aware how many sensors and computer systems are actually in their plant." – Luke van Enkhuizen

> "The licensing costs for connecting machines through OPC UA can be substantial - manufacturers end up spending significant amounts yearly just to get data." – Denis Gontcharov

> "Something has to give - your profit margins are really not that outstanding. Why not just get the data and measure what you want to improve? Otherwise you won't." – Denis Gontcharov
