In this episode of the Smart Metals Podcast, hosts Dennis Gontcharov and Luke van Enkhuizen explore the challenges and common pitfalls of digitalization in the metals manufacturing sector. 

They discuss the high failure rate of digital transformation initiatives, the difficulty in transitioning from pilot projects to full-scale implementation, and the absence of comprehensive digital strategies with a focus on data infrastructure and quality. The conversation addresses the misalignment between IT and OT departments, the drawbacks of relying on legacy solutions, and the essential role of a unified data strategy in breaking down operational silos. 

They emphasize the importance of leveraging internal domain knowledge, minimizing dependence on external consultants, and ensuring that technology adoption directly supports specific business objectives. The episode underlines the need to begin with a clear digital strategy, involve domain experts, and view technology as a tool to enhance business processes, crucial for successful digital transformation in the metals industry.
