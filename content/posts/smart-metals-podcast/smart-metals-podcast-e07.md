This week at the Smart Metals Podcast, we had a conversation about the state of Unified Namespace (UNS) adoption in the European metals industry. We were joined by Angelo Hulshout, a seasoned software architect, to discuss the unique challenges and opportunities that UNS presents for metals manufacturers in Europe.

We delved deeper into the cultural differences between Europe and the U.S. in adopting innovative technologies like UNS and the practical steps manufacturers can take to start their digital transformation.

If your current challenge is navigating the complexities of UNS implementation in the metals industry, then listen to this episode when you have a moment.

## Notable Quotes:

> "The biggest challenge with Unified Namespace adoption in Europe is not the technology itself, but the cultural approach to innovation." â€“ Denis Gontcharov

> "MQTT is becoming a game changer in real-time data exchange, especially when compared to traditional systems in manufacturing." â€“ Angelo Hulshout

> "It's not completely tailored to you and then you can get it almost for free in software terms, but you just have to put more effort into it, defining how you want it." â€“ Luke van Enkhuizen

> "Manufacturers need to start small with UNS adoption, focusing on low-risk areas like time tracking and inventory traceability to demonstrate value." â€“ Angelo Hulshout

> "In the metals industry, especially, Unified Namespace can dramatically improve operational efficiency by providing real-time insights into production processes, reducing waste, and enhancing traceability." â€“ Denis Gontcharov

> "I think the key takeaway is finding out where you can make the biggest bang for your buck, where these things would be able to launch quickly next to the business or building on top of the business without having to exchange systems." â€“ Luke van Enkhuizen
