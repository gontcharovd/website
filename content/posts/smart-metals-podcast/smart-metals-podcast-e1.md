In this debut episode of the Smart Metals Podcasting Show, hosts Luke van Enkhuizen and Denis delve into the world of Industry 4.0, focusing on the critical shift from data science to data engineering within industrial environments. 

Denis shares his journey from a data scientist to a data engineer, sparked by the challenge of accessing and preparing data for analysis in the metal industry. He highlights the insufficiency of current systems to support the data analytics needed for Industry 4.0 and argues for a separate digital infrastructure for control and analytics. 

The discussion also covers the limitations of traditional ERP systems for real-time data analysis and the potential of a unified namespace to streamline data integration across various operational levels. 

The episode concludes with insights into establishing a robust digital infrastructure to support data-driven operations and the necessary mindset for companies embarking on their digital transformation journey.
