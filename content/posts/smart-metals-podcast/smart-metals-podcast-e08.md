In this episode of the Smart Metals podcast, we (Denis Gontcharov and Luke Van Enkhuizen) had the pleasure of hosting Wim Dijkgraaf, founder and CEO of Quotation Factory. We discussed the challenges and solutions in high mix, low volume manufacturing, focusing on the impact of Event-Driven Architectures (EDA) and Unified Namespace (UNS) in transforming the metalworking industry.

Wim shared how Quotation Factory leverages advanced systems to estimate production times, streamline operations, and enhance responsiveness.

We also dove into the concept of semantic hierarchy and explored the potential for AI in building autonomous, smart factories. The episode wraps up with insights on how these architectures can make manufacturers more agile, reliable, and ready for digital transformation.

# Notable Quotes:

> "If you create point-to-point connections, both parties should understand the world on the other side. This creates complexity and increases the time and cost of integrations. That's why event-driven architecture adds value." â€“ Wim Dijkgraaf

> "Many metalworking companies believe they have a lot of data because itâ€™s in their ERP. But to become a smart factory, the critical information is actually the events happening in real time." â€“ Wim Dijkgraaf

> "You want to observe and store events as they happen, with all the necessary data tied to that moment. That's what a good data strategy is aboutâ€”capturing events." â€“ Wim Dijkgraaf

> "When thereâ€™s a manufacturing issue, like a standstill or quality concern, you need data from several systems to identify the root cause. If you rely only on the ERP, you lose real-time insight." â€“ Luke Van Enkhuizen

> "The Unified Namespace allows all your dataâ€”whether from sensors or MES systemsâ€”to be unified in one place. This semantic hierarchy makes it easy for both humans and machines to navigate and understand the data." â€“ Denis Gontcharov
