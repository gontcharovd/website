In this new video I share how to overcome Azure CPU quota limits with Databricks Asset Bundles, a common roadblock many Databricks practitioners face when deploying Databricks Asset Bundles on Azure for the first time.

# Problem

If you're playing around with Databricks projects, Azure's default CPU quota limits often fall short of what Databricks Asset Bundle Python template jobs and pipelines actually need to run.

# Solution

I demonstrate how to get your entire workflow running end-to-end using the Databricks VS Code extension, plus share how to adjust Azure CPU quotas to execute the job.

In the video, I also break down the complex Python project template structure (because let's be honest - there are a lot of files and directories!) and show you the actual results running in Databricks.

Perfect for data engineers working with Databricks who want to streamline their software development process
