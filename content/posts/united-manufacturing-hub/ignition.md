*This video was recorded by me for the [United Manufacturing Hub](https://www.umh.app/)*

In this tutorial, we guide you through the process of integrating Ignition by Inductive Automation with the United Manufacturing Hub (UMH). The objective is to build an operational dashboard in Ignition that displays real-time MQTT data coming from the UMH, using UMH as a Unified Namespace (UNS).
