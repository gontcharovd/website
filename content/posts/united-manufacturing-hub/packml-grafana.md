In this tutorial, we guide you through the process of building a Grafana dashboard based on the PackML model. We begin with a look at the PackML MQTT simulator, which simulates a real production line using the PackML standard and integrates with MQTT for messaging. Following this, we build a dashboard that can display various machine states (such as Starting, Running, Stopped, etc.), operational metrics, and alarms or notifications. In addition, we'll cover how to use the management console and explain how to work with the overall data model.
