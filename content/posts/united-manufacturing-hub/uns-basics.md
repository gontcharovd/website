*This video was recorded by me for the [United Manufacturing Hub](https://www.umh.app/)*

In this first part of the UNS Basics mini series, we introduce the Automation Pyramid as a system to control the plant. We highlight the challenges related to data analytics and present the Unified Namespace as the solution. We also show how the Automation Pyramid connects to the Unified Namespace, according to the United Manufacturing Hub's philosophy. Finally, we briefly discuss where historical data from the Unified Namespace is saved.
