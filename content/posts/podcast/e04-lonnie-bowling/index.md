I'm excited to share the latest episode of the Industrial Data Podcast featuring Lonnie Bowling, founder of Diemus Consulting. We explore the fascinating evolution of OT data integration, from basic SCADA trend-viewing to today's cloud-based AI analytics.

Lonnie shares how historians like OSIsoft PI transformed from simple tools to enterprise-wide platforms, while discussing the ongoing industry consolidation (AVEVA acquisition of OSIsoft) reshaping the landscape.

Despite technological advances, we're wrestling with old problems: the challenges of proprietary formats, inconsistent naming conventions, and questionable data quality persist as companies migrate to platforms like Databricks for advanced analytics.

# Key Ideas:

* Historians evolved from simple trend-viewing tools within SCADA systems to specialized products like OSIsoft PI that could connect multiple systems. 
* The industry is experiencing consolidation, with AVEVA (now part of Schneider) acquiring OSIsoft PI and other players to build integrated stacks. 
* Despite technological advances, legacy systems will remain for decades, especially in control functions. 
* Problems include proprietary formats, inconsistent naming conventions, connectivity issues with distributed systems, and poor data quality. 
* Companies are increasingly moving data to cloud platforms like Databricks for better analytics capabilities and computing power, though often without clear objectives.
