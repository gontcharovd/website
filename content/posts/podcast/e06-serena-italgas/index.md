This time I had the pleasure of inviting Serena Delli to discuss how she deployed AI Agents at Bludigit - Italgas to help both IT and business people with troubleshooting and resolving operational tickets.

Is your team getting buried under a pile of ServiceNow tickets with fuzzy descriptions and unclear objectives? Find out how you can automate some of that mind numbing work!

## My favorite notes

* Sometimes the agent can solve the problem so that no ServiceNow ticket needs to be created at all.
* A general agent "general physician" forwards tough requests to a specialized agent "cardiologist".
* Hosting everything on Databricks allowed Italgas to double the rate of projects they deliver while reducing their cloud bill.
