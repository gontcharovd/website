Today I published a 30 minute talk about my career in data thus far. I've made many mistakes along the way, but learned a tonne from them. Although I made many jumps over the years, I'm happy I always stuck around the central theme of data. Perhaps my talk can give you some inspiration if you feel stuck?

Topics include:

* How I ended up in data after graduating in Materials Science and working in aluminium.
* How I started freelancing, but ended up employed again.
* Why I decided to freelance again
* What I did better the second time.
* Why I'm focusing on Databricks in the future.
